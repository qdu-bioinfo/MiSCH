# Microbial Dysbiosis and its Diagnostic Potential in Androgenetic Alopecia: Insights from Multi-Kingdom Sequencing and Machine Learning
Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common form of hair loss, with a complex pathogenesis involving genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Recent studies suggest that scalp microbiome dysbiosis is not only associated with scalp-related diseases but may also play a significant role in AGA development. In this study, we recruited 89 participants from China, including healthy controls and individuals with varying degrees of AGA. Scalp samples were collected from both the frontal balding and occipital regions of each participant, yielding a total of 178 samples for comprehensive microbiome profiling. Notably, dysbiosis patterns were not confined to balding regions but were observed across the entire scalp.
### MiSCH
Leveraging multi-kingdom microbial biomarkers, we developed a robust multi-class machine learning model. Using this model, we introduced the Microbial Scalp Health Index (MiSCH), a novel metric integrating Jensen-Shannon distances and multi-class model probability outputs. MiSCH effectively distinguished AGA patients from healthy controls, revealing significant microbial differences. Moreover, MiSCH identified high-risk samples that exhibited microbial profiles characteristic of severe AGA despite the absence of overt clinical symptoms. These findings suggest that microbial dysbiosis may precede clinical manifestations of AGA, providing a foundation for early diagnosis and risk assessment.
